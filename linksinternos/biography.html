          Florian Cloud de Bounevialle O'Malley Armstrong (born 25 December
          1971), known professionally as Dido (/ˈdaɪdoʊ/ DY-doh), is an English
          singer and songwriter. Dido attained international success with her
          debut album No Angel (1999). Hit singles from the album include "Here
          with Me" and "Thank You". It sold over 21 million copies worldwide,
          and won her several awards, including two Brit Awards: Best British
          Female and Best British Album, and the MTV Europe Music Award for Best
          New Act. The first verse of "Thank You" is sampled in "Stan", a
          collaboration with American rapper Eminem. Her next album, Life for
          Rent (2003), continued her success with the hit singles "White Flag"
          and "Life for Rent". In 2004, Dido performed with other British and
          Irish artists in the Band Aid 20 version of the charity single "Do
          They Know It's Christmas?". Dido's first two albums are among the
          best-selling albums in UK chart history, and both are in the top 10
          best-selling albums of the 2000s in the UK. Her third studio album,
          Safe Trip Home (2008), received critical acclaim but failed to
          duplicate the commercial success of her previous efforts. She was
          nominated for an Academy Award for the song "If I Rise". Dido was
          ranked No. 98 on the Billboard chart of the top Billboard 200 artists
          of the 2000s (2000–2009) based on the success of her albums in the
          first decade of the 21st century. Dido made a comeback in 2013,
          releasing her fourth studio album Girl Who Got Away, which reached the
          top 5 in the UK. Having taken time out of the music industry to raise
          her son, she reappeared on stage at the 2013 Reading and Leeds
          festival where she reunited with Eminem.Dido released her fifth studio
          album, Still on My Mind, on 8 March 2019 and embarked on her first
          tour in 15 years in support of the new album. In May 2019, Dido
          received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from
          the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

          Dido signed to BMG to release her fifth album in early 2019. Dido
          worked with her brother and long-time collaborator Rollo Armstrong,
          along with Rick Nowels and Ryan Louder. On 9 November 2018, Dido
          announced her new album's title, Still on My Mind, along with its
          cover. It was released on 8 March 2019 and charted at number 3 on the
          UK Albums chart, number 1 on the UK Indie Album chart and sold over
          60,000 copies in the UK. The teaser single "Hurricanes" was released
          on 12 November 2018. The official lead single "Give You Up" was
          premiered 22 January 2019 on BBC Radio 2. The single peaked at number
          32 on the UK Singles Download chart. It peaked at number 1 on the US
          Dance Club Songs chart. "Give You Up" was followed by edited versions
          of "Take You Home" (released 5 April 2019) and "Friends" (released 22
          July 2019) as singles. Dido toured in support of the album from May
          2019, making it her first world tour in 15 years. The deluxe edition
          of the album was released on 15 November 2019 but failed to chart,
          despite the release of another single, "Just Because". In October
          2019, Dido was featured on her brother Rollo's The Last Summer album,
          which was released under the alias "R Plus". The album charted at
          number 96 on the UK Album Sales Chart.
